Short summary

  Sensory and affective responses can be shaped by multiple ingredients such as sensory and conceptual
information, social and affective values, past memories, relevance to the 'self', etc. All these ingredients
construct affective meaning, which could dramatically change the sensory and affective responses even to the
same stimuli. Here we aim to understand how the ingredients of affective meaning are represented and
processed in the brain by using participants' personal stories. In particular, we focused on identifying distinct
brain representations of two key dimensions in affective meaning, self-relevance and valence, which are
known to be highly correlated and co-localized within the brain.
  In this study, through one-on-one interviews, we created personal stories for each participant and
used them as task stimuli to elicit personal thoughts and emotions that are closely related to the participants'
real-life. We conducted an fMRI experiment with 49 participants (mean age = 22.8, 21 females)
while they underwent the story reading task, where participants were asked to read 4 self-generated stories
and 6 common stories written by others. The common stories were the same across all participants. After the
fMRI session, participants provided continuous ratings of self-relevance and valence for the stories that they
read in the scanner.
  To obtain distinct brain maps of self-relevance and valence, two different modeling approaches are
used: 1) the general linear modeling (GLM) with parametric modulation and 2) predictive modeling. In the GLM
analysis, we included multiple regressors, including the word viewing, the number of characters, and ratings of
self-relevance and valence in order to identify brain regions that preferentially track each variable controlling
for others. In addition, we used the predictive modeling approach to develop distinct pattern-based
neuromarkers of self-relevance and valence ratings. To effectively disentangle fMRI patterns for self-relevance
versus valence, we created orthogonalized training data by merging TR-level images and included the other dimension score as a covariate in the principal component regression analysis.
  Story reading compared to the baseline activated multiple brain regions within the default mode
network (DMN), including the medial prefrontal cortex, and also subcortical regions, including the
hippocampus and amygdala, suggesting that the semantic processing is dominant during story reading. The
parametric modulation results showed that the self-relevance ratings were preferentially
associated with ventral attention and frontoparietal network regions, whereas the valence ratings were
associated with the sensory processing (somatomotor and visual) regions and brainstem, and both showed
negative activations in the DMN. These findings are quite different from what has been known in the field (e.g.,
both self and valence activate the DMN regions), suggesting that previous findings of self and valence are likely
to be masked by semantic processing, which is also recruiting the DMN.
  We developed pattern-based markers for each of self-relevance and valence ratings
controlling for the other dimension. The predictive performances with the leave-one-participant-out crossvalidation
were r (correlation between actual and predicted ratings) = 0.32 for the self-relevance marker and r
= 0.205 for valence ratings. The self-relevance marker was able to discriminate whether the story was selfgenerated
or not with accuracy of 94%.
